## Level Complete!

Three years have finally flown by. The milestone that always felt so far away has passed, taken away with the tick of time as a new journey awaits. Memories surged through me as I walked up the stage, flashing moments in my mind. It felt surreal, as time slowly consumes past events.

## 10th Grade

10th Grade was a weird journey for my 18-year-old self. It felt unreal, like a strange dream during sick nights. 2021 was still in the mid-pandemic era, when staying home was the safest option. The pandemic taught me a lot, leading to many bad decisions and a downfall in my academic pride. Lessons felt boring, and I hardly had any motivation to study. It remains one of my biggest regrets, as the naive and ignorant me overlooked the future and the consequences of my actions.

Social interactions were extremely rare. I didn't meet any friends until the second semester of 2022, when offline classes started. Fortunately, as offline classes became more encouraged, my academic results slowly improved. Suddenly, it was time for final exams and holiday seasons again, and 11th Grade was just around the corner.

## Peak?

11th Grade was arguably one of the best times in my high school life. Online study was finally over, motivating me to study harder. One of my proudest moments was achieving 10th rank in the District-Level National Science Olympiad in Mathematics.

However, during this "peak" season, my sleep became unstable. Sleep hours were cut short during exam periods, and it slowly grew into a habit. Homework and group projects became more common, especially in the 4th semester.

## Life Plan

Initially, during 11th Grade, I dreamed of getting a Bachelor's Degree in Europe. Before then, I focused more on the present than the future, and a "life plan" was always a short-lived, unrealistic dream. Surfing the internet led me to consider public universities in my home country. I landed on a new "life plan" which also didn't materialize: Studying psychology at [Padjadjaran University of Bandung](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Padjadjaran_University).

After disapprovals, discussions, and heated dinner conversations, the plan for Europe was scrapped. My parents convinced me to study abroad in China, enrolling me in a Summer Camp in 2023. I was amazed. There was a period of uncertainty when I was figuring out the best major for me before I chose my ongoing passion: IT. Will I regret it? Maybe, maybe not.

## Nearing The End

In November 2023, life became more serious. Six months before Graduation, I hadn't made any concrete decisions about my future. Discussions started, but I procrastinated. It wasn't until 2024 that I got serious about my future.

I started applying to universities, starting from my main plan: China. My parents again convinced me to create another university plan as a backup. [National Test-Based Selection (SNBT)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SNBT) became my Plan D, where I applied to [Gadjah Mada University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gadjah_Mada_University) and [Bandung Institute of Technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bandung_Institute_of_Technology). After Plan D, private universities came to mind as Plan E to H.

## Luck Be With You

Life isn't life if everything goes according to plan. Failures motivate you to try harder. I was lucky to ace my last semester scores and rank 9th in class. Though some university plans failed, I was grateful for my parents' suggestion to create backup plans (thanks, Mom and Dad).

Through all the horrible decisions and my ups-and-downs, I consider myself lucky. The National Selection Test result came out in June, and I secured a seat at Gadjah Mada University. It was shocking, as the major I applied to is one of the [hardest to pass](https://ugm.ac.id/en/news/acceptance-rate-dips-below-3-5-ugm-unveils-most-competitive-programs-in-snbt-pathway/). I ended up celebrating by dancing around a mall like a buffoon.

I'm still waiting for more good news, but for now, at least I have a backup. I no longer need to worry about my "life plan" for the next four years. ~~Or I might just get a Master's Degree~~

## The Road Ahead

High school won't be the end of a nostalgic journey. I'll keep calm and course through this new stage of life. Though I still wonder if I'm prepared, the joy in me can't wait to explore more of this world. I have so many plans to create and places to see. I'm excited to see where this journey will take me, how it will shape my future, and I'm positive (for now) it'll be a bright one.
