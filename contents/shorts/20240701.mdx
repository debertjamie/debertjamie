Visual Studio Code has a built-in support for port forwarding via Microsoft Dev Tunnels (does not require downloading extensions), which can make the service accessible to other people over the internet. By default, tunnels are private and only accessible to the creator (requires sign-in with the associated Github account), but can be changed to public.
